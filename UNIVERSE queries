DataStage Engine UNIVERSE queries
UNIVERSE has been used as DataStage repository since the beginning. HAWK release (v8.0) introduces new Repository layer where jobs are
stored in RDBMS (DB2,Oracle,MS SqlServer). UNIVERSE stilL in use in V11.7!

Some useful queries

1. From the DataStage Administrator client select a project, click the command button and then execute the command:

LIST DS_JOBS JobName
LIST DS_JOBS JOBNO WITH NAME = "your job name"

where JobName is the name of the job you want to obtain the job number. 
This job number will be displayed in in the line that starts with "No....".
Note: Conversely, if you have a job number want to know what job is associated with that id you can run the command:

LIST DS_JOBS WITH JOBNO=X

where X is the job number.

2. From Director Client, open the log view of the job and double click on any entry of the log. 
The job number will be listed under the field "Job Number:"

How do you generate a list of parallel DataStage jobs that use a particular parameter environment variable?
Open the DataStage Administrator Client

Click on the Projects tab and select the project you would like to generate a list for.
Click the Command Button
In the command entry box type:
LIST DS_JOBS WITH JOBTYPE = 3 AND EVAL "TRANS('DS_JOBOBJECTS','J\':@RECORD<5>:'\ROOT',14,'X')" LIKE ...<VARNAME>...

<VARNAME> should be the name of the parameter or environment variable
Example:
LIST DS_JOBS WITH JOBTYPE = 3 AND EVAL "TRANS('DS_JOBOBJECTS','J\':@RECORD<5>:'\ROOT',14,'X')" LIKE ...TMPDIR...
Click Execute
If the output is on more than one page, click Next to page done and click Close when finished.

In this example, a job type of 3 is a parallel job. Valid job types value are:
0 = Server
1 = Mainframe
2 = Sequence
3 = Parallel

Finding a Input Dataset used in jobs
SELECT 
   DISTINCT DS_JOBS.NAME AS JOB_NAME FMT '100L', 
   DS_JOBS.CATEGORY FMT '100L', 
   DS_JOBOBJECTS.NAME AS OBJECT_NAME FMT '100L', 
   DS_JOBOBJECTS.OLETYPE FMT '100L', 
   EVAL DS_JOBOBJECTS."if index(@RECORD,'FIND ME',1) > 0 then 'FOUND' else ''" AS FOUND FMT '5L' 
FROM 
   DS_JOBS, 
   DS_JOBOBJECTS 
WHERE 
   DS_JOBS.JOBNO = DS_JOBOBJECTS.OBJIDNO 
   and FOUND = 'FOUND' 
GROUP BY 
   JOB_NAME, 
   DS_JOBS.CATEGORY, 
   OBJECT_NAME, 
   DS_JOBOBJECTS.OLETYPE, 
   FOUND 
;
