Some useful queries

1. From the DataStage Administrator client select a project, click the command button and then execute the command:

LIST DS_JOBS JobName

where JobName is the name of the job you want to obtain the job number. 
This job number will be displayed in in the line that starts with "No....".
Note: Conversely, if you have a job number want to know what job is associated with that id you can run the command:

LIST DS_JOBS WITH JOBNO=X

where X is the job number.

2. From Director Client, open the log view of the job and double click on any entry of the log. 
The job number will be listed under the field "Job Number:"
